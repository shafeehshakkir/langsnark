# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: shafeeh bin shakkir SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

### Project Description
A Raspberry Pi-powered rap generator that scans nearby Wi-Fi networks, then drops a custom diss track targeting their SSIDs

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
well some people around us have really creative wifi names, come on its time we apprecite their efforts rt?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
well one way to solve this issue in a creative is ig to turn it into a rap song including the SSID, haha creative rt?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages: Python 3.11 (main code), Bash (for Wi-Fi scanning)

Frameworks: LangGraph (for flow orchestration)

Libraries:

  google-generativeai (Gemini 1.5 Flash API)

  python-dotenv (environment variables)

  subprocess + nmcli + iw (network scanning)

  espeak (offline TTS)

  ffmpeg / aplay (audio playback)

  Tools: Raspberry Pi OS terminal, .env for API keys

For Hardware:

Main component: Raspberry Pi 3 (2.4 GHz Wi-Fi)

Specifications: Quad-core 1.2GHz CPU, 1GB RAM, onboard Wi-Fi

Tools required:

Power supply for Pi

MicroSD card (OS + code)

External speakers or 3.5mm audio output

Internet connection for AI requests

### Implementation
For Software:
--> Clone repo
git clone (https://github.com/shafeehshakkir/langsnark/)

--> Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

--> Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

--> Install system tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y espeak ffmpeg nmcli iw


# Run
python wifi_rapgraph.py
#.env should have gemini api
